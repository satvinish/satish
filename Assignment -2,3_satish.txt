1. Create an m x n matrix with replicate(m, rnorm(n)) with m=10 column vectors of n=10 elements each, constructed with rnorm(n), which creates random normal numbers. Then we transform it into a dataframe (thus 10 observations of 10 variables) and perform an algebraic operation on each element using a nested for loop: at each iteration, every element referred by the two indexes is incremented by a sinusoidal function, compare the vectorized and non-vectorized form of creating the solution and report the system time differences.
Ans:
Set.seed(42);
M=10; n=10;
Mymat<-replicate(m, rnormm(n))
Mydframe=data.frame(mymat)
For (I in 1:m)  {
For(j in 1:n)   {
Mydframe[I, j<-mydframe[I, j] + 10*sin(0.75*pi)
Print(mydframe)
}
}
